Code Conventions...

Big part of group projects is writing code in a consistent and readable way.
	- Helps with debugging
	- Improves code readability
	- Makes interfacing with other people's code much easier

They're simple, really

1. Files:
	A. Descriptive names - addUser.py, editUser.py, deleteUser.py ...
		One glance and you immediately know what the purpose of the code is, right?
	B. Camelhumps - addUserIsNamedInCamelCase.py
		The capital letters at the start of each work make it easier to read the file name.

2. Variables:
	A. Descriptive names are rad ...
		for i in array : ...  Not nearly as helpful as...
		for rows in dbResults
	B. Descriptions can't be too long ...
		wellTheyActuallyCanJustBeSmartAboutItAndItWillBeFine = 100

3. Classes:
	A. Class Names - capitalize first letter ...
		ClassForThing
	B. Class Object - use good variable conventions ...
		classForThing

Feel free to add, change these if you have good reasons and feels to do so. Cheers.
